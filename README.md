# ArcadeGame
Python code for a Mario like Arcade Game. 
This code was designed on Python version 3.6 along with Pygame version 1.9.1
On running the code, the canvas will open, where we see the player, the dragon that emits flames, cactii on top and flames at the bottom of the screen. The game uses the up and down arrow keys to work. Dodging the flames and the cactii and flames progresses the game. touching anyone of these you lose. The game has 4 levels, where the channel of movement reduces with every level depending on the score. 
The code uses object oriented programming to define classes for the player, the dragon and the flames that are repeatedly called depending on their requirement.
